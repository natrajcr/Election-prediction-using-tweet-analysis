# Election-prediction-using-tweet-analysis.
This project is used to predict the election results by people support,slogans.To complete this project I needed visual studios,google collab,jupyter notebook,Anaconda powershell prompt.
The challenges I faced by doing this project is finding the minute errors in the programs which took a lot of time to get corrected and finding the dataset was bit difficult.
By the information I received from the datasets my project will be able to solve the problem by predicting the election results. 
By doing this project I learned how to use anaconda prompt shell,jupyter notebook,google collab and visual studios.
I needed to do this project because by doing this project on time I can get motivated by doing many project by myself in the coming years.
I chose this project because it helps you to gain knowledge and confidence and self motivation.
How to run the Election prediction Project using Python Machine learning:
  1.Download the project zip file.
  2.Extract the file
  3.Download the required Dataset to do this project.
  4.Copy the code and paste it on Visual Studios and run the program.
  5.Paste the project in the jupyter notebook or Google collab and run the program by completing the errors.
